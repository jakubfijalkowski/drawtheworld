## Draw the World

Boring bus ride? Lessons seem to go on forever? You want a game that has simple rules but forces you to think for a solution? Or you just want to try something new? Draw the World is for you!

Play one of the most addictive logic game known from papers right on your PC or tablet. Based on the well-known "Japanese crosswords", Draw the World gives new yet classical gameplay that will attract you for long hours.

Your goal is to paint the picture according to the clues left by its author. Seems easy? It may be, but who knows how challenging boards somebody has created? 

This game is available in [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/pl-pl/p/draw-the-world/9wzdncrfjv47).

### Some notes about the game

It isn't the cleanest nor best-written code on the Earth and I would make it completly differently now, but I've learned a lot when creating it. Publishing it to the store and getting rather bad reviews was also a *great* experience.

Nevertheless, 7 years passed since last publication and I finally decided to update the game to Windows 10 (hopefully it does not crash that often now). Along the process I decided to open-source it, since it really wasn't going to bring me any meaningful profit otherwise. That move at least gives me another thing to put here. :)

The project had also some server code but that isn't really worth watching at (but maybe some day I will add it here). The commit history has also been reduced to minimum because I might have put some secrets there (which probably I haven't, but I just want to be sure).

I created it as my first "real" product almost 8 years ago, not so long after I learned how to code, so keep that in mind when reading it. :)
